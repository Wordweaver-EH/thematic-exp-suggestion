## Theme Refinement Recommendations

### Merge Considerations
1. Combine Force Experience with Movement Automaticity
   - Create "Movement-Force Dynamics"
   - Focus on integrated experience
   - Maintain distinct components

2. Integrate Experience Development into Engagement
   - Focus on progression patterns
   - Maintain development aspects
   - Strengthen engagement focus

### Final Theme Structure

#### Core Themes
1. **Movement-Force Dynamics**
   - Automaticity aspects
   - Force sensations
   - Integration patterns

2. **Processing Mode Dynamics**
   - Analytical vs experiential
   - Reality testing
   - Belief integration

3. **Engagement-Development**
   - Progressive engagement
   - Integration patterns
   - Experience depth

### Theme Relationships

#### Primary Relationships
1. Movement-Force ↔ Processing
   - Mode impacts experience
   - Experience influences processing
   - Integration patterns

2. Processing ↔ Engagement
   - Mode affects depth
   - Engagement influences processing
   - Development patterns

3. Engagement ↔ Movement-Force
   - Depth affects experience
   - Experience enhances engagement
   - Integration support

## Theoretical Framework

### Core Components
1. Experience Integration
   - Movement-force binding
   - Processing balance
   - Engagement depth

2. Development Patterns
   - Progressive integration
   - Processing shifts
   - Engagement growth

3. Success Factors
   - Automaticity support
   - Processing balance
   - Engagement depth

### Success Indicators
1. Strong automaticity
2. Balanced processing
3. Deep engagement
4. Clear progression
5. Effective integration

### Barrier Patterns
1. Control dominance
2. Analytical interference
