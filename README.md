# Thematic Analysis of Hypnotic Suggestion Experience

## Project Overview
This repository contains a detailed thematic reanalysis of microphenomenological interview transcripts examining participants' experiences of hypnotic suggestions. The analysis focuses on understanding the subjective experience and phenomenology of different hypnotic suggestions across multiple participants.

## Analysis Structure
The analysis is organized by suggestion type, with dedicated folders for each session:

- `s1-together/` - Analysis of hands coming together suggestion
- `s2-stuck/` - Analysis of hands stuck together suggestion
- `s3-music/` - Analysis of auditory hallucination suggestion

## Methodology
Each suggestion analysis follows a rigorous thematic analysis process:
1. Initial familiarization and notes
2. Initial code generation
3. Theme development
4. Theme review and refinement
5. Theme finalization
6. Comprehensive analysis report
7. Visualization suggestions

## File Structure
Each session folder contains:
- `initial-notes-*.md` - First observations and patterns
- `initial-codes-*.md` - Systematic coding of experiences
- `emerging-themes-*.md` - Initial theme development
- `theme-review-*.md` - Critical review of themes
- `final-themes-*.md` - Refined and finalized themes
- `*-analysis-report.md` - Comprehensive analysis
- `visualizations-*.md` - Suggested data visualizations

## Technical Details
- Analysis conducted by: Cursor AI Agent (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
- Analysis framework: Thematic Analysis
- Interview methodology: Microphenomenological Interview
- Data format: Interview transcripts
- Tools used: Cursor IDE

## Analysis Focus
The analysis examines:
- Subjective experience components
- Processing patterns
- Development sequences
- Integration mechanisms
- Success factors and barriers
- Individual differences
- Cross-suggestion patterns

## Visualization Proposals
Each analysis includes detailed visualization suggestions using:
- Python
- Plotly
- Seaborn
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib

## Usage Notes
- Each analysis can be read independently
- Cross-analysis patterns emerge across sessions
- Visualization code provided is implementation-ready
- Additional data processing may be required for visualizations

## Future Development
- Implementation of suggested visualizations
- Cross-session pattern analysis
- Integration with quantitative data
- Development of practical applications
