## Emerging Patterns

### Response Distribution
- High Responders (4-5): P4, P6
- Low Responders (0-1): P1, P2, P3, P5, P7
- Notable gap between high and low responders

### Common Elements
1. Internal Processes:
   - Most participants experienced internal singing
   - Volume modulation common across experiences
   - Clear distinction between internal/external

2. Alternative Modalities:
   - Visual imagery common compensation
   - Emotional components in successful cases
   - Cultural/personal memory integration

3. Processing Styles:
   - Analytical approach often inhibitory
   - Automatic processing associated with success
   - Prior knowledge/expectations influential

4. Individual Differences:
   - Clear sensory preferences
   - Cultural/linguistic influences
   - Personal history effects

### Key Observations
1. Success appears linked to:
   - Reduced analytical processing
   - Automatic/involuntary responses
   - Integration with personal meaning

2. Barriers to success:
   - Strong reality testing
   - Prior knowledge interference
   - Analytical approach

3. Compensatory Strategies:
   - Visual imagery
   - Personal memory integration
   - Cultural adaptation
