Using thematic analysis in
psychology

Thematic analysis is a poorly demarcated, rarely acknowledged, yet widely
used qualitative analytic method within psychology. In this paper, we
argue that it offers an accessible and theoretically flexible approach to
analysing qualitative data. We outline what thematic analysis is, locating it
in relation to other qualitative analytic methods that search for themes or
patterns, and in relation to different epistemological and ontological
positions. We then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start
thematic analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and
consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis. Finally, we
outline the disadvantages and advantages of thematic analysis. We
conclude by advocating thematic analysis as a useful and flexible method
for qualitative research in and beyond psychology. Qualitative Research in

Thematic analysis is a poorly demarcated
and rarely acknowledged, yet widely used
qualitative analytic method (Boyatzis,
1998; Roulston, 2001) within and beyond
psychology. In this paper, we aim to fill
what we, as researchers and teachers in
qualitative psychology, have experienced
as a current gap / the absence of a paper
which adequately outlines the theory, application and evaluation of thematic analysis, and one which does so in a way
accessible to students and those not particularly familiar with qualitative research.1
That is, we aim to write a paper that will
be useful as both a teaching and research
tool in qualitative psychology. Therefore,
in this paper we discuss theory and
method for thematic analysis, and clarify

different approaches that share features in
common with a thematic approach.
Qualitative approaches are incredibly
diverse, complex and nuanced (Holloway
and Todres, 2003), and thematic analysis
should be seen as a foundational method
for qualitative analysis. It is the first
qualitative method of analysis that researchers should learn, as it provides core
skills that will be useful for conducting
many other forms of qualitative analysis.
Indeed, Holloway and Todres (2003: 347)
identify ‘thematizing meanings’ as one of a
few shared generic skills across qualitative
analysis.2 For this reason, Boyatzis (1998)
characterizes it, not as a specific method,
but as a tool to use across different methods. Similarly, Ryan and Bernard (2000)
locate thematic coding as a process performed within ‘major’ analytic traditions
(such as grounded theory), rather than a
specific approach in its own right. We
argue thematic analysis should be considered a method in its own right.
One of the benefits of thematic analysis is
its flexibility. Qualitative analytic methods
can be roughly divided into two camps.
Within the first, there are those tied to, or
stemming from, a particular theoretical or
epistemological position. For some of these
/ such as conversation analysis (CA; eg,
Hutchby and Wooffitt, 1998) and interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA; eg,
Smith and Osborn, 2003) / there is (as yet)
relatively limited variability in how the
method is applied, within that framework.
In essence, one recipe guides analysis. For
others of these / such as grounded theory
(Glaser, 1992; Strauss and Corbin, 1998),
discourse analysis (DA; eg, Burman and
Parker, 1993; Potter and Wetherell, 1987;
Willig, 2003) or narrative analysis (Murray,
2003; Riessman, 1993) / there are different
manifestations of the method, from within
the broad theoretical framework. Second,
there are methods that are essentially independent of theory and epistemology, and
can be applied across a range of theoretical
and epistemological approaches. Although
often (implicitly) framed as a realist/experiential method (Aronson, 1994; Roulston,
2001), thematic analysis is actually firmly
in the second camp, and is compatible with
both essentialist and constructionist paradigms within psychology (we discuss this
later). Through its theoretical freedom, thematic analysis provides a flexible and useful research tool, which can potentially
provide a rich and detailed, yet complex,
account of data.
Given the advantages of the flexibility of
thematic analysis, it is important that we are
clear that we are not trying to limit this
flexibility. However, an absence of clear and
concise guidelines around thematic analysis
means that the ‘anything goes’ critique of
qualitative research (Antaki et al., 2002) may
well apply in some instances. With this
paper, we hope to strike a balance between
demarcating thematic analysis clearly / ie,
explaining what it is, and how to do it / and
ensuring flexibility in relation to how it is
used, so that it does not become limited and
constrained, and lose one of its key advantages. Indeed, a clear demarcation of this
method will be useful to ensure that those
who use thematic analysis can make active
choices about the particular form of analysis
they are engaged in. Therefore, this paper
seeks to celebrate the flexibility of the
method and provide a vocabulary and
‘recipe’ for people to undertake thematic
analysis in a way that is theoretically and
methodologically sound.3 As we will show,
what is important is that as well as applying a method to data, researchers make
their (epistemological and other) assump-
78 V Braun and V Clarketions explicit (Holloway and Todres, 2003).
Qualitative psychologists need to be clear
about what they are doing and why, and to
include the often-omitted ‘how’ they did
their analysis in their reports (AttrideStirling, 2001).
In this paper we outline: what thematic
analysis is; a 6-phase guide to performing
thematic analysis; potential pitfalls to
avoid when doing thematic analysis; what
makes good thematic analysis; and advantages and disadvantages of thematic analysis. Throughout, we provide examples from the research literature, and our
own research. By providing examples, we
show the types of research questions and
topics that thematic analysis can be used to
study.
Before we begin, we need to define a few
of the terms used throughout the paper.
Data corpus refers to all data collected for
a particular research project, while data set
refers to all the data from the corpus that
are being used for a particular analysis.
There are two main ways of choosing the
data set (which approach you take depends
on whether you are coming to the data
with a specific question or not / see ‘A
number of decisions’ below). First, the data
set may consist of many, or all, individual
data items within your data corpus. So, for
example, in a project on female genital
cosmetic surgery, Virginia’s data corpus
consists of interviews with surgeons,
media items on the topic, and surgeon
websites. For any particular analysis, her
data set might just be the surgeon interviews, just the websites (Braun, 2005b), or
it might combine surgeon data with some
media data (eg, Braun, 2005a). Second, the
data set might be identified by a particular
analytic interest in some topic in the data,
and the data set then becomes all instances
in the corpus where that topic is referred.
So in Virginia’s example, if she was interested in how ‘sexual pleasure’ was talked
about, her data set would consist of all
instances across the entire data corpus that
had some relevance to sexual pleasure.
These two approaches might sometimes
be combined to produce the data set. Data
item is used to refer to each individual
piece of data collected, which together
make up the data set or corpus. A data
item in this instance would be an individual surgeon interview, a television documentary, or one particular website. Finally,
data extract refers to an individual coded
chunk of data, which has been identified
within, and extracted from, a data item.
There will be many of these, taken from
throughout the entire data set, and only a
selection of these extracts will feature in
the final analysis.
What is thematic analysis?
Thematic analysis is a method for identifying, analysing and reporting patterns
(themes) within data. It minimally organizes and describes your data set in (rich)
detail. However, frequently if goes further
than this, and interprets various aspects of
the research topic (Boyatzis, 1998). The
range of different possible thematic analyses will further be highlighted in relation
to a number of decisions regarding it as a
method (see below).
Thematic analysis is widely used, but
there is no clear agreement about what
thematic analysis is and how you go about
doing it (see Attride-Stirling, 2001; Boyatzis, 1998; Tuckett, 2005, for other examples). It can be seen as a very poorly
‘branded’ method, in that it does not appear
to exist as a ‘named’ analysis in the same
way that other methods do (eg, narrative
Using thematic analysis in psychology 79analysis, grounded theory). In this sense, it
is often not explicitly claimed as the
method of analysis, when, in actuality, we
argue that a lot of analysis is essentially
thematic / but is either claimed as something else (such as DA, or even content
analysis (eg, Meehan et al., 2000)) or not
identified as any particular method at all /
for example, data were ‘subjected to qualitative analysis for commonly recurring
themes’ (Braun and Wilkinson, 2003: 30).
If we do not know how people went about
analysing their data, or what assumptions
informed their analysis, it is difficult to
evaluate their research, and to compare
and/or synthesize it with other studies on
that topic, and it can impede other researchers carrying out related projects in the
future (Attride-Stirling, 2001). For these
reasons alone, clarity on process and practice of method is vital. We hope that this
paper will lead to more clarity around
thematic analysis.
Relatedly, insufficient detail is often given to reporting the process and detail of
analysis (Attride-Stirling, 2001). It is not
uncommon to read of themes ‘emerging’
from the data (although this issue is not
limited to thematic analysis). For example,
Singer and Hunter’s (1999: 67) thematic
discourse analysis of women’s experiences
of early menopause identified that ‘several
themes emerged’ during the analysis. Rubin
and Rubin (1995: 226) claim that analysis is
exciting because ‘you discover themes and
concepts embedded throughout your interviews’. An account of themes ‘emerging’ or
being ‘discovered’ is a passive account of
the process of analysis, and it denies the
active role the researcher always plays in
identifying patterns/themes, selecting
which are of interest, and reporting them
to the readers (Taylor and Ussher, 2001).4
The language of ‘themes emerging’:
can be misinterpreted to mean that themes ‘reside’ in the data, and if we just look hard enough
they will ‘emerge’ like Venus on the half shell.
If themes ‘reside’ anywhere, they reside in
our heads from our thinking about our data and
creating links as we understand them. (Ely et al.,
1997: 205/6)
At this point, it is important to acknowledge
our own theoretical positions and values in
relation to qualitative research. We do not
subscribe to a naı¨ve realist view of qualitative research, where the researcher can
simply ‘give voice’ (see Fine, 2002) to their
participants. As Fine (2002): 218) argues,
even a ‘giving voice’ approach ‘involves
carving out unacknowledged pieces of
narrative evidence that we select, edit,
and deploy to border our arguments’. However, nor do we think there is one ideal
theoretical framework for conducting qualitative research, or indeed one ideal method.
What is important is that the theoretical
framework and methods match what the
researcher wants to know, and that they
acknowledge these decisions, and recognize
them as decisions.
Thematic analysis differs from other analytic methods that seek to describe patterns
across qualitative data / such as ‘thematic’
DA, thematic decomposition analysis, IPA
and grounded theory.5 Both IPA and
grounded theory seek patterns in the data,
but are theoretically bounded. IPA is attached to a phenomenological epistemology
(Smith et al., 1999; Smith and Osborn,
2003), which gives experience primacy
(Holloway and Todres, 2003), and is about
understanding people’s everyday experience of reality, in great detail, in order to
gain an understanding of the phenomenon
in question (McLeod, 2001). To complicate
matters, grounded theory comes in different
versions (Charmaz, 2002). Regardless, the
goal of a grounded theory analysis is to
generate a plausible / and useful / theory
80 V Braun and V Clarkeof the phenomena that is grounded in the
data (McLeod, 2001). However, in our experience, grounded theory seems increasingly to be used in a way that is essentially
grounded theory ‘lite’ / as a set of procedures for coding data very much akin to
thematic analysis. Such analyses do not
appear to fully subscribe to the theoretical
commitments of a ‘full-fat’ grounded theory,
which requires analysis to be directed towards theory development (Holloway and
Todres, 2003). We argue, therefore, that a
‘named and claimed’ thematic analysis
means researchers need not subscribe to
the implicit theoretical commitments of
grounded theory if they do not wish to
produce a fully worked-up grounded-theory
analysis.
The term ‘thematic DA’ is used to refer to
a wide range of pattern-type analysis of
data, ranging from thematic analysis within
a social constructionist epistemology (ie,
where patterns are identified as socially
produced, but no discursive analyse is
conducted), to forms of analysis very
much akin to the interpretative repertoire
form of DA (Clarke, 2005). Thematic decomposition analysis (eg, Stenner, 1993; Ussher
and Mooney-Somers, 2000) is a specifically
named form of ‘thematic’ DA, which identifies patterns (themes, stories) within data,
and theorizes language as constitutive of
meaning and meaning as social.
These different methods share a search
for certain themes or patterns across an
(entire) data set, rather than within a data
item, such as an individual interview or
interviews from one person, as in the case of
biographical or case-study forms of analysis, such as narrative analysis (eg, Murray,
2003; Riessman, 1993). In this sense, they
more or less overlap with thematic analysis.
As thematic analysis does not require the
detailed theoretical and technological
knowledge of approaches, such as grounded
theory and DA, it can offer a more accessible
form of analysis, particularly for those early
in a qualitative research career.
In contrast to IPA or grounded theory (and
other methods like narrative analysis DA or
CA), thematic analysis is not wedded to any
pre-existing theoretical framework, and
therefore it can be used within different
theoretical frameworks (although not all),
and can be used to do different things
within them. Thematic analysis can be an
essentialist or realist method, which reports
experiences, meanings and the reality of
participants, or it can be a constructionist
method, which examines the ways in which
events, realities, meanings, experiences and
so on are the effects of a range of discourses
operating within society. It can also be a
‘contextualist’ method, sitting between the
two poles of essentialism and constructionism, and characterized by theories, such as
critical realism (eg, Willig, 1999), which
acknowledge the ways individuals make
meaning of their experience, and, in turn,
the ways the broader social context impinges on those meanings, while retaining
focus on the material and other limits of
‘reality’. Therefore, thematic analysis can be
a method that works both to reflect reality
and to unpick or unravel the surface of
‘reality’. However, it is important that the
theoretical position of a thematic analysis is
made clear, as this is all too often left
unspoken (and is then typically a realist
account). Any theoretical framework carries
with it a number of assumptions about the
nature of the data, what they represent in
terms of the ‘the world’, ‘reality’, and so
forth. A good thematic analysis will make
this transparent.
A number of decisions
Thematic analysis involves a number of
choices which are often not made explicit
Using thematic analysis in psychology 81(or are certainly typically not discussed in
the method section of papers), but which
need explicitly to be considered and discussed. In practice, these questions should
be considered before analysis (and sometimes even collection) of the data begins,
and there needs to be an ongoing reflexive
dialogue on the part of the researcher or
researchers with regards to these issues,
throughout the analytic process. The
method section of Taylor and Ussher’s
(2001) thematic DA of S&M provides a
good example of research which presents
this process explicitly; the method section
of Braun and Wilkinson (2003) does not.
What counts as a theme?
A theme captures something important
about the data in relation to the research
question, and represents some level of
patterned response or meaning within the
data set. An important question to address
in terms of coding is: what counts as a
pattern/theme, or what ‘size’ does a theme
need to be? This is a question of prevalence,
in terms both of space within each data item
and of prevalence across the entire data set.
Ideally, there will be a number of instances
of the theme across the data set, but more
instances do not necessarily mean the
theme itself is more crucial. As this is
qualitative analysis, there is no hard-andfast answer to the question of what proportion of your data set needs to display
evidence of the theme for it to be considered
a theme. It is not the case that if it was
present in 50% of one’s data items, it would
be a theme, but if it was present only in
47%, then it would not be a theme. Nor is it
the case that a theme is only something that
many data items give considerable attention
to, rather than a sentence or two. A theme
might be given considerable space in some
data items, and little or none in others, or it
might appear in relatively little of the data
set. So, researcher judgement is necessary to
determine what a theme is. Our initial
guidance around this is that you need to
retain some flexibility, and rigid rules really
do not work. (The question of prevalence is
revisited in relation to themes and subthemes, as the refinement of analysis (see
later) will often result in overall themes,
and sub-themes within those.)
Furthermore, the ‘keyness’ of a theme is
not necessarily dependent on quantifiable
measures / but rather on whether it captures something important in relation to
the overall research question. For example, in Victoria’s research on representations of lesbians and gay parents on 26
talk shows (Clarke and Kitzinger, 2004),
she identified six ‘key’ themes. These six
themes were not necessarily the most prevalent themes across the data set / they
appeared in between two and 22 of the 26
talk shows / but together they captured an
important element of the way in which
lesbians and gay men ‘normalize’ their
families in talk show debates. In this instance, her thematic analysis was driven by
this particular analytic question. How she
‘measured’ prevalence is relevant, as prevalence can be determined in a number of
different ways. Prevalence was counted at
the level of the data item (ie, did a theme
appear anywhere in each individual talk
show?). Alternatively, it could have been
counted in terms of the number of different
speakers who articulated the theme, across
the entire data set, or each individual
occurrence of the theme across the entire
data set (which raises complex questions
about where an ‘instance’ begins and ends
within an extended sequence of talk / see
Riessman, 1993). Because prevalence was
not crucial to the analysis presented, Victoria chose the most straightforward form,
82 V Braun and V Clarkebut it is important to note there is no right or
wrong method for determining prevalence.
Part of the flexibility of thematic analysis
is that it allows you to determine themes
(and prevalence) in a number of ways. What
is important is that you are consistent in
how you do this within any particular
analysis.
There are various ‘conventions’ for representing prevalence in thematic (and other
qualitative) analysis that does not provide a
quantified measure (unlike much content
analysis, Wilkinson, 2000) / for instance:
‘the majority of participants’ (Meehan et al.,
2000: 372), ‘many participants’ (Taylor and
Ussher, 2001: 298), or ‘a number of
participants’ (Braun et al., 2003: 249).
Such descriptors work rhetorically to
suggest a theme really existed in the data,
and to convince us they are reporting
truthfully about the data. But do they tell
us much? This is perhaps one area where
more debate is needed about how and why
we might represent the prevalence of
themes in the data, and, indeed, whether,
if, and why prevalence is particularly important.
A rich description of the data set, or a
detailed account of one particular aspect
It is important to determine the type of
analysis you want to do, and the claims
you want to make, in relation to your data
set. For instance, you might wish to provide
a rich thematic description of your entire
data set, so that the reader gets a sense of the
predominant or important themes. In this
case, the themes you identify, code, and
analyse would need to be an accurate reflection of the content of the entire data set. In
such an analysis, some depth and complexity is necessarily lost (particularly if you are
writing a short dissertation or article with
strict word limits), but a rich overall description is maintained. This might be a
particularly useful method when you are
investigating an under-researched area, or
you are working with participants whose
views on the topic are not known.
An alternative use of thematic analysis is
to provide a more detailed and nuanced
account of one particular theme, or group of
themes, within the data. This might relate to
a specific question or area of interest within
the data (a semantic approach / see below),
or to a particular ‘latent’ theme (see below)
across the whole or majority of the data set.
An example of this would be Victoria’s talk
show paper, discussed previously (Clarke
and Kitzinger, 2004), which examined normalization in lesbians’ and gay men’s accounts of parenting.
Inductive versus theoretical thematic
analysis
Themes or patterns within data can be
identified in one of two primary ways in
thematic analysis: in an inductive or ‘bottom up’ way (eg, Frith and Gleeson, 2004),
or in a theoretical or deductive or ‘top
down’ way (eg, Boyatzis, 1998; Hayes,
1997). An inductive approach means the
themes identified are strongly linked to the
data themselves (Patton, 1990) (as such, this
form of thematic analysis bears some similarity to grounded theory). In this approach,
if the data have been collected specifically
for the research (eg, via interview or focus
group), the themes identified may bear little
relation to the specific questions that were
asked of the participants. They would also
not be driven by the researcher’s theoretical
interest in the area or topic. Inductive
analysis is therefore a process of coding
the data without trying to fit it into a preexisting coding frame, or the researcher’s
analytic preconceptions. In this sense, this
form of thematic analysis is data-driven.
Using thematic analysis in psychology 83However, it is important to note, as we
discussed earlier, that researchers cannot
free themselves of their theoretical and
epistemological commitments, and data
are not coded in an epistemological vacuum.
In contrast, a ‘theoretical’ thematic analysis would tend to be driven by the researcher’s theoretical or analytic interest in the
area, and is thus more explicitly analystdriven. This form of thematic analysis tends
to provide less a rich description of the data
overall, and more a detailed analysis of
some aspect of the data. Additionally, the
choice between inductive and theoretical
maps onto how and why you are coding the
data. You can either code for a quite specific
research question (which maps onto the
more theoretical approach) or the specific
research question can evolve through the
coding process (which maps onto the inductive approach).
For example, if a researcher was interested in talk about heterosex, and had
collected interview data, with an inductive
approach they would read and re-read the
data for any themes related to heterosex,
and code diversely, without paying attention to the themes that previous research on
the topic might have identified. For example, the researcher would not look to the
influential research of Hollway (1989),
identifying discourses of heterosex, and
code just for male sexual drive, have/hold
or permissive discourse themes. In contrast,
with a theoretical approach, the researcher
may well be interested in the way permissiveness plays out across the data, and
focus on that particular feature in coding
the data. This would then result in a
number of themes around permissiveness,
which may include, speak to, or expand on
something approximating Hollway’s original theme.
Semantic or latent themes
Another decision revolves around the ‘level’ at which themes are to be identified: at
a semantic or explicit level, or at a latent or
interpretative level (Boyatzis, 1998).6 A
thematic analysis typically focuses exclusively or primarily on one level. With a
semantic approach, the themes are identified within the explicit or surface meanings
of the data, and the analyst is not looking for
anything beyond what a participant has
said or what has been written. Ideally, the
analytic process involves a progression from
description, where the data have simply
been organized to show patterns in semantic content, and summarized, to interpretation, where there is an attempt to theorize
the significance of the patterns and their
broader meanings and implications (Patton,
1990), often in relation to previous literature
(for an excellent example of this, see Frith
and Gleeson, 2004).
In contrast, a thematic analysis at the
latent level goes beyond the semantic content of the data, and starts to identify or
examine the underlying ideas, assumptions,
and conceptualizations / and ideologies /
that are theorized as shaping or informing
the semantic content of the data. If we
imagine our data three-dimensionally as
an uneven blob of jelly, the semantic
approach would seek to describe the surface
of the jelly, its form and meaning, while the
latent approach would seek to identify the
features that gave it that particular form and
meaning. Thus, for latent thematic analysis,
the development of the themes themselves
involves interpretative work, and the analysis that is produced is not just description, but is already theorized.
Analysis within this latter tradition tends
to come from a constructionist paradigm
(eg, Burr, 1995), and in this form, thematic
analysis overlaps with some forms of ‘DA’
84 V Braun and V Clarke(which are sometimes specifically referred
to as ‘thematic DA’ (eg, Singer and Hunter,
1999; Taylor and Ussher, 2001)), where
broader assumptions, structures and/or
meanings are theorized as underpinning
what is actually articulated in the data.
Increasingly, a number of discourse analysts
are also revisiting psycho-analytic modes of
interpretation (eg, Hollway and Jefferson,
2000), and latent thematic analysis would
also be compatible with that framework.
Epistemology: essentialist/realist versus
constructionist thematic analysis
As we have argued, thematic analysis can be
conducted within both realist/essentialist
and constructionist paradigms, although
the outcome and focus will be different for
each. The question of epistemology is
usually determined when a research project
is being conceptualized, although epistemology may also raise its head again during
analysis, when the research focus may shift
to an interest in different aspects of the data.
The research epistemology guides what you
can say about your data, and informs how
you theorize meaning. For instance, with an
essentialist/realist approach, you can theorize motivations, experience, and meaning
in a straightforward way, because a simple,
largely unidirectional relationship is assumed between meaning and experience
and language (language reflects and enables
us to articulate meaning and experience)
(Potter and Wetherell, 1987; Widdicombe
and Wooffitt, 1995).
In contrast, from a constructionist perspective, meaning and experience are socially produced and reproduced, rather
than inhering within individuals (Burr,
1995). Therefore, thematic analysis conducted within a constructionist framework
cannot and does not seek to focus on
motivation or individual psychologies, but
instead seeks to theorize the sociocultural
contexts, and structural conditions, that
enable the individual accounts that are
provided. Thematic analysis that focuses
on ‘latent’ themes tends to be more constructionist, and it also tends to start to
overlap with thematic DA at this point.
However, not all ‘latent’ thematic analysis
is constructionist.
The many questions of qualitative research
It is worth briefly noting that qualitative
research involves a series of questions, and
there is a need to be clear about the relationship between these different questions.
First, there is the overall research question
or questions that drive the project. A research question might be very broad (and
exploratory), such as ‘how is lesbian and
gay parenting constructed?’ or ‘what are the
meanings of the vagina?’. Narrower research
questions might be ‘how and why is lesbian
and gay parenting normalized?’ (Clarke and
Kitzinger, 2004), or ‘what are the discourses
around vaginal size?’ (see Braun and Kitzinger, 2001). These narrow questions may
be part of a broader overarching research
question, and if so, the analyses they inform
would also provide answers to the overall
research question. Although all projects are
guided by research questions, these may
also be refined as a project progresses.
Second, if data from interviews or focus
groups have been collected, there are the
questions that participants have responded
to. Finally, there are the questions that
guide the coding and analysis of the data.
There is no necessary relationship between
these three, and indeed, it is often desirable
that there is a disjuncture between them.
Some of the worst examples of ‘thematic’
analysis we have read have simply used
the questions put to participants as the
‘themes’ identified in the ‘analysis’ /
Using thematic analysis in psychology 85although in such instances, no analysis has
really been done at all!
To sum up, thematic analysis involves the
searching across a data set / be that a
number of interviews or focus groups, or a
range of texts / to find repeated patterns of
meaning. The exact form and product of
thematic analysis varies, as indicated above,
and so it is important that the questions
outlined above are considered before and
during thematic analyses. Those approaches which consider specific aspects, latent themes and are constructionist tend to
often cluster together, while those that
consider meanings across the whole data
set, semantic themes, and are realist, often
cluster together. However, there are no hardand-fast rules in relation to this, and different combinations are possible. What is
important is that the finished product contains an account / not necessarily that
detailed / of what was done, and why. So
what does one actually do? We now provide
what is, we hope, a straightforward stepby-step guide to conducting thematic analysis.
Doing thematic analysis: a step-by-step
guide
Some of the phases of thematic analysis are
similar to the phases of other qualitative
research, so these stages are not necessarily
all unique to thematic analysis. The process
starts when the analyst begins to notice,
and look for, patterns of meaning and
issues of potential interest in the data /
this may be during data collection. The
endpoint is the reporting of the content
and meaning of patterns (themes) in the
data, where ‘themes are abstract (and often
fuzzy) constructs the investigators identify
[sic] before, during, and after analysis’
(Ryan and Bernard, 2000: 780). Analysis
involves a constant moving back and forward between the entire data set, the coded
extracts of data that you are analysing, and
the analysis of the data that you are producing. Writing is an integral part of analysis,
not something that takes place at the end, as
it does with statistical analyses. Therefore,
writing should begin in phase one, with the
jotting down of ideas and potential coding
schemes, and continue right through the
entire coding/analysis process.
There are different positions regarding
when you should engage with the literature
relevant to your analysis / with some
arguing that early reading can narrow your
analytic field of vision, leading you to focus
on some aspects of the data at the expense
of other potentially crucial aspects. Others
argue that engagement with the literature
can enhance your analysis by sensitizing
you to more subtle features of the data
(Tuckett, 2005). Therefore, there is no one
right way to proceed with reading for thematic analysis, although a more inductive
approach would be enhanced by not engaging with literature in the early stages of
analysis, whereas a theoretical approach
requires engagement with the literature
prior to analysis.
We provide an outline guide through the
six phases of analysis, and offer examples to
demonstrate the process.7 The different
phases are summarized in Table 1. It is
important to recognize that qualitative analysis guidelines are exactly that / they are
not rules, and, following the basic precepts,
will need to be applied flexibly to fit the
research questions and data (Patton, 1990).
Moreover, analysis is not a linear process of
simply moving from one phase to the next.
Instead, it is more recursive process, where
movement is back and forth as needed,
throughout the phases. It is also a process
86 V Braun and V Clarkethat develops over time (Ely et al., 1997),
and should not be rushed.
Phase 1: familiarizing yourself with your
data
When you engage in analysis, you may have
collected the data yourself, or they may have
been given to you. If you collected them
through interactive means, you will come to
the analysis with some prior knowledge of
the data, and possibly some initial analytic
interests or thoughts. Regardless, it is vital
that you immerse yourself in the data to the
extent that you are familiar with the depth
and breadth of the content. Immersion
usually involves ‘repeated reading’ of the
data, and reading the data in an active way /
searching for meanings, patterns and so on.
It is ideal to read through the entire data set
at least once before you begin your coding,
as ideas and identification of possible patterns will be shaped as you read through.
Whether or not you are aiming for an
overall or detailed analysis, are searching
for latent or semantic themes, or are data- or
theoretically-driven will inform how the
reading proceeds. Regardless, it is important to be familiar with all aspects of your
data. At this phase, one of the reasons why
qualitative research tends to use far smaller
samples than, for example, questionnaire
research will become apparent / the reading and re-reading of data is time-consuming. It is, therefore, tempting to skip over
this phase, or be selective. We would
strongly advise against this, as this phase
provides the bedrock for the rest of the
analysis.
During this phase, it is a good idea to start
taking notes or marking ideas for coding
that you will then go back to in subsequent
phases. Once you have done this, you are
ready to begin, the more formal coding
process. In essence, coding continues to be
developed and defined throughout the entire analysis.
Transcription of verbal data
If you are working with verbal data, such as
interviews, television programmes or political speeches, the data will need to be
transcribed into written form in order to
conduct a thematic analysis. The process of
transcription, while it may seen time-consuming, frustrating, and at times boring, can
be an excellent way to start familiarizing
yourself with the data (Riessman, 1993).
Further, some researchers even argue
it should be seen as ‘a key phase of
data analysis within interpretative qualitative methodology’ (Bird, 2005: 227), and
recognized as an interpretative act, where
Table 1 Phases of thematic analysis
Phase Description of the process
1. Familiarizing yourself
with your data:
Transcribing data (if necessary), reading and re-reading the data, noting down
initial ideas.
2. Generating initial codes: Coding interesting features of the data in a systematic fashion across the entire
data set, collating data relevant to each code.
3. Searching for themes: Collating codes into potential themes, gathering all data relevant to each
potential theme.
4. Reviewing themes: Checking if the themes work in relation to the coded extracts (Level 1) and the
entire data set (Level 2), generating a thematic ‘map’ of the analysis.
5. Defining and naming
themes:
Ongoing analysis to refine the specifics of each theme, and the overall story the
analysis tells, generating clear definitions and names for each theme.
6. Producing the report: The final opportunity for analysis. Selection of vivid, compelling extract
examples, final analysis of selected extracts, relating back of the analysis to the
research question and literature, producing a scholarly report of the analysis.
Using thematic analysis in psychology 87meanings are created, rather than simply a
mechanical act of putting spoken sounds on
paper (Lapadat and Lindsay, 1999).
Various conventions exist for transforming
spoken texts into written texts (see Edwards
and Lampert, 1993; Lapadat and Lindsay,
1999). Some systems of transcription have
been developed for specific forms of analysis
/ such as the ‘Jefferson’ system for CA (see
Atkinson and Heritage, 1984; Hutchby and
Wooffitt, 1998). However, thematic analysis,
even constructionist thematic analysis, does
not require the same level of detail in the
transcript as conversation, discourse or even
narrative analysis. As there is no one way to
conduct thematic analysis, there is no one set
of guidelines to follow when producing a
transcript. However, at a minimum it requires a rigorous and thorough ‘orthographic’ transcript / a ‘verbatim’ account of
all verbal (and sometimes nonverbal / eg,
coughs) utterances.8 What is important is
that the transcript retains the information
you need, from the verbal account, and in a
way which is ‘true’ to its original nature (eg,
punctuation added can alter the meaning of
data / for example ‘I hate it, you know. I do’
versus ‘I hate it. You know I do’, Poland,
2002: 632), and that the transcription convention is practically suited to the purpose of
analysis (Edwards, 1993).
As we have noted, the time spent in
transcription is not wasted, as it informs
the early stages of analysis, and you will
develop a far more thorough understanding
of your data through having transcribed it.
Furthermore, the close attention needed to
transcribe data may facilitate the close reading and interpretative skills needed to analyse the data (Lapadat and Lindsay, 1999). If
your data have already been, or will be,
transcribed for you, it is important that you
spend more time familiarising yourself with
the data, and also check the transcripts back
against the original audio recordings for
‘accuracy’ (as should always be done).
Phase 2: generating initial codes
Phase 2 begins when you have read and
familiarized yourself with the data, and have
generated an initial list of ideas about what
is in the data and what is interesting about
them. This phase then involves the production of initial codes from the data. Codes
identify a feature of the data (semantic
content or latent) that appears interesting
to the analyst, and refer to ‘the most basic
segment, or element, of the raw data or
information that can be assessed in a meaningful way regarding the phenomenon’
(Boyatzis, 1998: 63). See Figure 1 for an
example of codes applied to a short segment
of data. The process of coding is part of
analysis (Miles and Huberman, 1994), as you
are organising your data into meaningful
groups (Tuckett, 2005). However, your
coded data differ from the units of analysis
(your themes), which are (often) broader.
Your themes, which you start to develop in
the next phase, are where the interpretative
analysis of the data occurs, and in relation to
which arguments about the phenomenon
being examined are made (Boyatzis, 1998).
Coding will, to some extent, depend on
whether the themes are more ‘data-driven’
or ‘theory-driven’ / in the former, the

Figure 1 Data extract, with codes applied (from Clarke et al., 2006)
88 V Braun and V Clarkethemes will depend on the data, but in the
latter, you might approach the data with
specific questions in mind that you wish to
code around. It will also depend on whether
you are aiming to code the content of the
entire data set, or whether you are coding to
identify particular (and possibly limited)
features of the data set. Coding can be
performed either manually or through a
software programme (see, eg, Kelle, 2004;
Seale, 2000, for discussion of software
programmes).
Work systematically through the entire
data set, giving full and equal attention to
each data item, and identify interesting
aspects in the data items that may form
the basis of repeated patterns (themes)
across the data set. There are a number of
ways of actually coding extracts. If coding
manually, you can code your data by writing notes on the texts you are analysing,
by using highlighters or coloured pens to
indicate potential patterns, or by using
‘post-it’ notes to identify segments of data.
You may initially identify the codes, and
then match them with data extracts that
demonstrate that code, but it is important in
this phase to ensure that all actual data
extracts are coded, and then collated together within each code. This may involve
copying extracts of data from individual
transcripts or photocopying extracts of
printed data, and collating each code together in separate computer files or using
file cards. If using computer software, you
code by tagging and naming selections of
text within each data item.
Key advice for this phase is: (a) code for as
many potential themes/patterns as possible
(time permitting) / you never know what
might be interesting later; (b) code extracts
of data inclusively / ie, keep a little of the
surrounding data if relevant, a common
criticism of coding is that the context is
lost (Bryman, 2001); and (c) remember that
you can code individual extracts of data in
as many different ‘themes’ as they fit into /
so an extract may be uncoded, coded once,
or coded many times, as relevant. Note that
no data set is without contradiction, and a
satisfactory thematic ‘map’ that you will
eventually produce / an overall conceptualization of the data patterns, and relationships between them9 / does not have to
smooth out or ignore the tensions and
inconsistencies within and across data
items. It is important to retain accounts
that depart from the dominant story in the
analysis, so do not ignore these in your
coding.
Phase 3: searching for themes
Phase 3 begins when all data have been
initially coded and collated, and you have a
long list of the different codes that you have
identified across the data set. This phase,
which re-focuses the analysis at the broader
level of themes, rather than codes, involves
sorting the different codes into potential
themes, and collating all the relevant coded
data extracts within the identified themes.
Essentially, you are starting to analyse your
codes and consider how different codes
may combine to form an overarching theme.
It may be helpful at this phase to use visual
representations to help you sort the different codes into themes. You might use tables,
or mind-maps, or write the name each code
(and a brief description) on a separate piece
of paper and play around with organizing
them into theme-piles. A thematic map of
this early stage can be seen in Figure 2 (the
examples in Figures 2/4 come from the
analysis presented in Braun and Wilkinson,
2003 of women’s talk about the vagina).
This is when you start thinking about the
relationship between codes, between
themes, and between different levels of
themes (eg, main overarching themes and
Using thematic analysis in psychology 89sub-themes within them). Some initial
codes may go on to form main themes,
whereas others may form sub-themes, and
others still may be discarded. At this stage,
you may also have a set of codes that do not
seem to belong anywhere, and it is perfectly
acceptable to create a ‘theme’ called ‘miscellaneous’ to house the codes / possibly
temporarily / that do not seem to fit into
your main themes.
You end this phase with a collection of
candidate themes, and sub-themes, and all
extracts of data that have been coded in
relation to them. At this point, you will start
to have a sense of the significance of
individual themes. However, do not abandon anything at this stage, as without
looking at all the extracts in detail (the
next phase) it is uncertain whether the
themes hold as they are, or whether some

Wilkinson, 2003)
Figure 3 Developed thematic map, showing three main themes (final analysis presented in Braun and
Wilkinson, 2003)
90 V Braun and V Clarkeneed to be combined, refined and separated,
or discarded.
Phase 4: reviewing themes
Phase 4 begins when you have devised a set
of candidate themes, and it involves the
refinement of those themes. During this
phase, it will become evident that some
candidate themes are not really themes (eg,
if there are not enough data to support them,
or the data are too diverse), while others
might collapse into each other (eg, two
apparently separate themes might form
one theme). Other themes might need
to be broken down into separate themes.
Patton’s (1990) for dual criteria judging
categories / internal homogeneity and external heterogeneity / are worth considering here. Data within themes should cohere
together meaningfully, while there should
be clear and identifiable distinctions between themes.
This phase involves two levels of reviewing and refining your themes. Level one
involves reviewing at the level of the coded
data extracts. This means you need to read
all the collated extracts for each theme, and
consider whether they appear to form a
coherent pattern. If your candidate themes
do appear to form a coherent pattern, you
then move on to the second level of this
phase. If your candidate themes do not fit,
you will need to consider whether the
theme itself is problematic, or whether
some of the data extracts within it simply
do not fit there / in which case, you would
rework your theme, creating a new theme,
finding a home for those extracts that do not
currently work in an already-existing
theme, or discarding them from the analysis. Once you are satisfied that your candidate themes adequately capture the
contours of the coded data / once you
have a candidate ‘thematic map’ / you
are ready to move on to level two of this
phase. The outcome of this refinement
process can be seen in the thematic map
presented in Figure 3.
Level two involves a similar process, but
in relation to the entire data set. At this
level, you consider the validity of individual themes in relation to the data set, but
also whether your candidate thematic map
‘accurately’ reflects the meanings evident in
the data set as a whole. To some extent,
what counts as ‘accurate representation’
depends on your theoretical and analytic
approach. However, in this phase you reread your entire data set for two purposes.
The first is, as discussed, to ascertain
whether the themes ‘work’ in relation to
the data set. The second is to code any
additional data within themes that has been
missed in earlier coding stages. The need for
re-coding from the data set is to be expected
as coding is an ongoing organic process.
If the thematic map works, then you
moves on to the next phase. However, if
the map does not fit the data set, you need
to return to further reviewing and refining
of your coding until you have devised a
Figure 4 Final thematic map, showing final two main themes (see Braun and Wilkinson, 2003).
Using thematic analysis in psychology 91satisfactory thematic map. In so doing, it is
possible that you will identify potential
new themes, and you will need to start
coding for these as well, if they are of
interest and relevent. However, a word
of warning: as coding data and generating
themes could go on ad infinitum, it is
important not to get over-enthusiastic with
endless re-coding. It is impossible to provide clear guidelines on when to stop, but
when your refinements are not adding anything substantial, stop! If the process of
recoding is only fine-tuning and making
more nuanced a coding frame that already
works / ie, it fits the data well / recognize
this and stop. Consider it as similar to
editing written work / you could endlessly
edit your sentences and paragraphs, but
after a few editing turns, any further work
is usually unnecessary refinement / similar
to rearranging the hundreds and thousands
on an already nicely decorated cake.
At the end of this phase, you should have
a fairly good idea of what your different
themes are, how they fit together, and the
overall story they tell about the data.
Phase 5: defining and naming themes
Phase 5 begins when you have a satisfactory
thematic map of your data / see Figure 4 for
the final refinements of Virginia’s thematic
map. At this point, you then define and
further refine the themes you will present
for your analysis, and analyse the data
within them. By ‘define and refine’, we
mean identifying the ‘essence’ of what
each theme is about (as well as the themes
overall), and determining what aspect of the
data each theme captures. It is important
not to try and get a theme to do too much, or
to be too diverse and complex. You do this
by going back to collated data extracts for
each theme, and organizing them into a
coherent and internally consistent account,
with accompanying narrative. It is vital that
you do not just paraphrase the content of
the data extracts presented, but identify
what is of interest about them and why.
For each individual theme, you need to
conduct and write a detailed analysis. As
well as identifying the ‘story’ that each
theme tells, it is important to consider
how it fits into the broader overall ‘story’
that you are telling about your data, in
relation to the research question or questions, to ensure there is not too much
overlap between themes. So it is necessary
to consider the themes themselves, and
each theme in relation to the others. As
part of the refinement, you will need to
identify whether or not a theme contains
any sub-themes. Sub-themes are essentially
themes-within-a-theme. They can be useful
for giving structure to a particularly large
and complex theme, and also for demonstrating the hierarchy of meaning within the
data. For instance, in one of Virginia’s
analyses of women’s talk about the vagina,
she identified two overarching themes in
women’s talk: the vagina as liability, and the
vagina as asset (Braun and Wilkinson,
2003). Within each theme, three sub-themes
were identified: for liability the sub-themes
were ‘nastiness and dirtiness’, ‘anxieties’
and ‘vulnerability’; for asset the sub-themes
were ‘satisfaction’, ‘power’ and ‘pleasure’.
However, these eventual final themes and
sub-themes resulted from a process of refinement of initial themes and sub-themes,
as shown in Figures 2/4.
It is important that by the end of this phase
you can clearly define what your themes are
and what they are not. One test for this is to
see whether you can describe the scope and
content of each theme in a couple of sentences. If not, further refinement of that
theme may be needed. Although you will
already have given your themes working
titles, this is also the point to start thinking
92 V Braun and V Clarkeabout the names you will give them in the
final analysis. Names need to be concise,
punchy, and immediately give the reader a
sense of what the theme is about.
Phase 6: producing the report
Phase 6 begins when you have a set of fully
worked-out themes, and involves the final
analysis and write-up of the report. The
task of the write-up of a thematic analysis, whether it is for publication or for a
research assignment or dissertation, is to
tell the complicated story of your data in a
way which convinces the reader of the merit
and validity of your analysis. It is important
that the analysis (the write-up of it, including data extracts) provides a concise, coherent, logical, non-repetitive and interesting
account of the story the data tell / within
and across themes. Your write-up must
provide sufficient evidence of the themes
within the data / ie, enough data extracts to
demonstrate the prevalence of the theme.
Choose particularly vivid examples, or extracts which capture the essence of the
point you are demonstrating, without unnecessary complexity. The extract should be
easily identifiable as an example of the
issue. However, your write-up needs to do
more than just provide data. Extracts need
to be embedded within an analytic narrative
that compellingly illustrates the story you
are telling about your data, and your analytic narrative needs to go beyond description
of the data, and make an argument in
relation to your research question.
Pinning down what interpretative
analysis actually entails
It is difficult to specify exactly what interpretative analysis actually entails, particularly as the specifics of it will vary from
study to study. As a first step, we recommend looking at published examples of
thematic analysis, particularly of the specific version you are planning to use (this is
made somewhat more difficult in that thematic analysis is often not a named method,
but you can find examples, eg, Ellis and
Kitzinger, 2002; Kitzinger and Willmott,
2002; Toerien and Wilkinson, 2004). In
order to provide a sense of the sorts of
questions you should be asking of your data,
and the sorts of analytic claims you should
be seeking to make, we will discuss a
particularly good example of an inductive
thematic analysis, which emphasizes understanding men’s experiences in relation to
the broader social context (see Frith and
Gleeson, 2004).
Frith and Gleeson (2004) aim to explore how men’s feelings about their
bodies influence their clothing practices,
and they use data gathered in qualitative
questionnaires from 75 men to answer
this question. They report four themes:
practicality of clothing choices; lack of
concern about appearance; use of clothing to conceal or reveal the body; use of
clothing to fit cultural ideals. Each theme
is clearly linked back to the overall
research question, but each is distinct.
They provide a clear sense of the scope
and diversity of each theme, using a
combination of analyst narrative and
illustrative data extracts. Where relevant,
they broaden their analysis out, moving
from a descriptive to an interpretative
level (often relating their claims to existing literature). For example, in ‘men
value practicality’, they make sense of
men’s accounts in relation to gender
norms and stereotypes, linking the accounts individual men provided to the
expectations that men / as members of
society / face. What they do, as analysts,
Using thematic analysis in psychology 93is relate the patterns of meaning in men’s
responses to an academic analysis of how
gender operates. In so doing, they demonstrate the dual position that analysts
need to take: as both cultural members
and cultural commentators. Their ‘discussion’ section makes broader analytic
statements about the overall story that
the themes tell us about men’s relationship with clothing. This story reveals
that men ‘deliberately and strategically
use clothing to manipulate their appearance to meet cultural ideals of masculinity’ (Frith and Gleeson, 2004: 45), in a
way more traditionally associated with
women. This analysis makes an important contribution in that it challenges
perceived wisdom about clothing/appearance and masculinity.
As this example demonstrates, your analytic claims need to be grounded in, but go
beyond, the ‘surface’ of the data, even for a
‘semantic’ level analysis. The sort of questions you need to be asking, towards the end
phases of your analysis, include: ‘What does
this theme mean?’ ‘What are the assumptions underpinning it?’ ‘What are the implications of this theme?’ ‘What conditions
are likely to have given rise to it?’ ‘Why
do people talk about this thing in this
particular way (as opposed to other
ways)?’ and ‘What is the overall story the
different themes reveal about the topic?’.
These sorts of questions should guide the
analysis once you have a clear sense of your
thematic map.
Potential pitfalls to avoid when doing
thematic analysis
Thematic analysis is a relatively straightforward form of qualitative analysis, which
does not require the same detailed theoretical and technical knowledge that approaches such as DA or CA do. It is
relatively easy to conduct a good thematic
analysis on qualitative data, even when you
are still learning qualitative techniques.
However, there are a number of things that
can result in a poor analysis. In this section
we identify these potential pitfalls, in the
hope that they can be avoided.
The first of these is a failure to actually
analyse the data at all! Thematic analysis is
not just a collection of extracts strung
together with little or no analytic narrative.
Nor is it a selection of extracts with analytic
comment that simply or primarily paraphrases their content. The extracts in thematic analysis are illustrative of the analytic
points the researcher makes about the data,
and should be used to illustrate/support an
analysis that goes beyond their specific
content, to make sense of the data, and tell
the reader what it does or might mean / as
discussed above. A second, associated pitfall is the using of the data collection
questions (such as from an interview schedule) as the ‘themes’ that are reported. In
such a case, no analytic work has been
carried out to identify themes across the
entire data set, or make sense of the patterning of responses.
The third is a weak or unconvincing
analysis, where the themes do not appear
to work, where there is too much overlap
between themes, or where the themes are
not internally coherent and consistent. All
aspects of the theme should cohere around a
central idea or concept. This pitfall has
occurred if, depending on what the analysis
is trying to do, it fails adequately to capture
the majority of the data, or fails to provide a
rich description/interpretation of one or
more aspects of the data. A weak or un-
94 V Braun and V Clarkeconvincing analysis can also stem from a
failure to provide adequate examples from
the data / for example, only one or two
extracts for a theme. This point is essentially about the rhetorics of presentation,
and the need for the analysis to be convincing to someone who has not read the entire
data set: ‘The ‘‘analysis’’ of the material. . . is
a deliberate and self-consciously artful creation by the researcher, and must be constructed to persuade the reader of the
plausibility of an argument’ (Foster and
Parker, 1995: 204). In so doing, one avoids
(the appearance of) what Bryman (1988) has
referred to as ‘anecdotalism’ in qualitative
research / where one or a few instances of a
phenomenon are reified into a pattern or
theme, when it or they are actually idiosyncratic. This is not to say that a few instances
cannot be of interest, or revealing; but it is
important not to misrepresent them as an
overarching theme.
The fourth pitfall is a mismatch between
the data and the analytic claims that are
made about it. In such an (unfounded)
analysis, the claims cannot be supported
by the data, or, in the worst case, the data
extracts presented suggest another analysis
or even contradict the claims. The researcher needs to make sure that their
interpretations and analytic points are consistent with the data extracts. A weak
analysis does not appear to consider other
obvious alternative readings of the data, or
fails to consider variation (and even contradiction) in the account that is produced. A
pattern in data is rarely, if ever, going to be
100% complete and non-contradicted, so an
analysis which suggests that it is, without a
thorough explanation, is open to suspicion.
It is important to pick compelling examples
to demonstrate the themes, so give this
considerable thought.
The fifth involves a mismatch between
theory and analytic claims, or between the
research questions and the form of thematic
analysis used. A good thematic analysis
needs to make sure that the interpretations
of the data are consistent with the theoretical
framework. So, for instance, if you are working within an experiential framework, you
would typically not make claims about the
social construction of the research topic, and
if you were doing constructionist thematic
analysis, you would not treat people’s talk
of experience as a transparent window on
their world. Finally, even a good and interesting analysis which fails to spell out
its theoretical assumptions, or clarify how it
was undertaken, and for what purpose, is
lacking crucial information (Holloway and
Todres, 2003), and thus fails in one aspect.
What makes good thematic analysis?
One of the criticisms of qualitative research
from those outside the field is the perception that ‘anything goes’. For instance, this
sentiment is echoed in the first sentence of
Laubschagne’s (2003) abstract: ‘For many
scientists used to doing quantitative studies
the whole concept of qualitative research is
unclear, almost foreign, or ‘‘airy fairy’’ / not
‘‘real’’ research.’ However, although ‘qualitative’ research cannot be subjected to the
same criteria as ‘quantitative’ approaches, it
does provide methods of analysis that
should be applied rigorously to the data.
Furthermore, criteria for conducting good
qualitative research / both data collection
and analysis / do exist (eg, Elliott et al.,
1999; Parker, 2004; Seale, 1999; Silverman,
2000; Yardley, 2000). The British Psychological Society offers relatively succinct online guidelines for assessing quality in qualitative research (see http://www.bps.org.
Using thematic analysis in psychology 95uk/publications/journals/joop/qualitativeguidelines.cfm). ‘Criteria’ for assessing qualitative research is a not uncontroversial
topic, with concerns raised about rigid
criteria limiting freedom and stifling methodological development (Elliott et al., 1999;
Parker, 2004; Reicher, 2000). Reicher (2000)
takes the critique further, by asking whether
the incredibly diverse range of qualitative
approaches can and should be subject to
the same criteria.
Bracketing these critiques off, the issues
raised in many general qualitative research
assessment criteria can be more or less
applied to thematic forms of analysis. As
thematic analysis is a flexible method, you
also need to be clear and explicit about what
you are doing, and what you say you are
doing needs to match up with what you
actually do. In this sense, the theory and
method need to be applied rigorously, and
‘rigour lies in devising a systematic method
whose assumptions are congruent with the
way one conceptualizes the subject matter’
(Reicher and Taylor, 2005: 549). A concise
checklist of criteria to consider when determining whether you have generated a good
thematic analysis is provided in Table 2.
So what does thematic analysis offer
psychologists?
We now end this paper with some brief
comments on the advantages and disadvantages of thematic analysis. As we have
shown throughout this paper, thematic analysis is not a complex method. Indeed, as
you can see from Table 3, its advantages are
many. However, it is not without some
disadvantages, which we will now briefly
consider. Many of the disadvantages depend more on poorly conducted analyses
or inappropriate research questions than on

3 Themes have not been generated from a few vivid examples (an anecdotal approach),
but instead the coding process has been thorough, inclusive and comprehensive.
4 All relevant extracts for all each theme have been collated.
5 Themes have been checked against each other and back to the original data set.
6 Themes are internally coherent, consistent, and distinctive.
Analysis 7 Data have been analysed / interpreted, made sense of / rather than just paraphrased
or described.
8 Analysis and data match each other / the extracts illustrate the analytic claims.
9 Analysis tells a convincing and well-organized story about the data and topic.
10 A good balance between analytic narrative and illustrative extracts is provided.
Overall 11 Enough time has been allocated to complete all phases of the analysis adequately,
without rushing a phase or giving it a once-over-lightly.
Written report 12 The assumptions about, and specific approach to, thematic analysis are clearly
explicated.
13 There is a good fit between what you claim you do, and what you show you have
done / ie, described method and reported analysis are consistent.
14 The language and concepts used in the report are consistent with the epistemological
position of the analysis.
15 The researcher is positioned as active in the research process; themes do not just
‘emerge’.
96 V Braun and V Clarkethe method itself. Further, the flexibility of
the method / which allows for a wide range
of analytic options / means that the potential range of things that can be said about
your data is broad. While this is an advantage, it can also be a disadvantage in that it
makes developing specific guidelines for
higher-phase analysis difficult, and can be
potentially paralysing to the researcher trying to decide what aspects of their data to
focus on. Another issue to consider is that a
thematic analysis has limited interpretative
power beyond mere description if it is not
used within an existing theoretical framework that anchors the analytic claims that
are made.
Other disadvantages appear when thematic analysis is considered in relation to
some of the other qualitative analytic methods. For instance, unlike narrative or other
biographical approaches, you are unable to
retain a sense of continuity and contradiction through any one individual account,
and these contradictions and consistencies
across individual accounts may be revealing. In contrast to methods similar to DA
and CA, a simple thematic analysis does not
allow the researcher to make claims about
language use, or the fine-grained functionality of talk.
Finally, it is worth noting that thematic
analysis currently has no particular kudos
as an analytic method / this, we argue,
stems from the very fact that it is poorly
demarcated and claimed, yet widely used.
This means that thematic analysis is frequently, or appears to be, what is simply
carried out by someone without the knowledge or skills to perform a supposedly more
sophisticated / certainly more kudos-bearing / ‘branded’ form of analysis like
grounded theory, IPA or DA. We hope this
paper will change this view as, we argue, a
rigorous thematic approach can produce an
insightful analysis that answers particular
research questions. What is important is
choosing a method that is appropriate to
your research question, rather than falling
victim to ‘methodolatry’, where you are
committed to method rather than topic/
content or research questions (Holloway
and Todres, 2003). Indeed, your method of
analysis should be driven by both your
research question and your broader theoretical assumptions. As we have demonstrated, thematic analysis is a flexible
approach that can be used across a range
of epistemologies and research questions.
Notes
1. Boyatzis (1998) provides a much more
detailed account of thematic analysis. However,
we do not feel that it is a particularly accessible
account for those unfamiliar with qualitative
approaches. Moreover, his approach differs
from ours in that, although he acknowledges
the subjective dimension of qualitative analysis,
his approach is ultimately, if often implicitly,
located within a positivist empiricist paradigm.
2. Dey’s (1993) account of on ‘qualitative data
analysis’, which aims to identify shared techniques across the diverse range of qualitative
Table 3 Advantages of thematic analysis
Flexibility.
Relatively easy and quick method to learn, and do.
Accessible to researchers with little or no experience of
qualitative research.
Results are generally accessible to educated general
public.
Useful method for working within participatory research paradigm, with participants as collaborators.
Can usefully summarize key features of a large body of
data, and/or offer a ‘thick description’ of the data set.
Can highlight similarities and differences across the
data set.
Can generate unanticipated insights.
Allows for social as well as psychological interpretations of data.
Can be useful for producing qualitative analyses suited
to informing policy development.
Using thematic analysis in psychology 97methods, and demonstrate how to do ‘qualitative
analysis’, reinforces this point in that his focus is
largely thematic / but not claimed as such.
3. Some authors, such as Potter (1997: 147/
48) argue that one should not simply provide
‘recipes’ for qualitative methods, such as DA,
because ‘a large part of doing discourse analysis
is a craft skill, more like bike riding or sexing a
chicken than following the recipe for a mild
chicken rogan josh. . . This makes it hard to
describe and learn’. While we do not disagree
that the skills needed for qualitative analyses of
all types need to be learned, others, such as
McLeod (2001), argue that by not discussing the
‘how to’ of analysis, we keep certain methods
mysterious (and thus elitist). Instead, if we want
to make methods democratic and accessible /
and indeed, to make qualitative research of all
forms more understandable to those not trained
in the methods, and arguably thus more popular
/ we need to provide concrete advice on how to
actually do it. We are not questioning the
importance of ‘non-recipe’ forms of training,
but while ‘recipes’ necessarily diminish the
complexity of certain methods, they are important for making methods accessible.
4. Foster and Parker (1995) suggest one
way to acknowledge the creative and active role
of the analyst is to use the first person when
writing.
5. Content analysis is another method that
can be used to identify patterns across qualitative
data, and is sometimes treated as similar to
thematic approaches (eg, Wilkinson, 2000). However, content analysis tends to focus at a more
micro level, often provides (frequency) counts
(Wilkinson, 2000), and allows for quantitative
analyses of initially qualitative data (Ryan and
Bernard, 2000). Thematic analysis differs from
this in that themes tend not to be quantified
(although sometimes they may be; and Boyatzis
(1998) suggests thematic analysis can be used to
transform qualitative data into a quantitative
form, and subject them to statistical analyses;
and the unit of analysis tends to be more than a
word or phrase, which it typically is in content
analysis.
6. The definition by Boyatzis (1998) of latent
and manifest is somewhat narrower than our
identification of latent and semantic, and he
identifies thematic analysis as incorporating
both latent and manifest aspects. However, this
results from the fact that he associates the
process of interpretation with latent analysis /
whereas we would argue that it should also be an
important element of a semantic approach.
7. We are assuming that you will be working
with a ‘good quality’ data corpus and data set.
We would argue that ‘good data’ are defined by a
particular set of criteria regarding what, why,
and how they were collected, and offer rich,
detailed and complex accounts of the topic.
Good data do not just provide a surface overview of the topic of interest, or simply reiterate a
commonsense account. The challenge for the
novice researcher is to interact with research
participants in such a way that they generate
rich and complex insights. Producing a good
analysis of poor quality data is a far more
demanding task for the analyst, although it can
potentially be performed by a skilled and experienced analyst.
8. See Poland (2002) for a discussion of the
problems with the idea of a ‘verbatim’ transcript,
and what is left out, and retained, through this
process.
9. What we mean by thematic map is similar
to, but less detailed than, the ‘codebook’ Ryan
and Bernard (2000) refer to, which involves a
detailed account of the hierarchical relationship
between codes, as well as a description of each,
their criteria, exemplars and counter / examples,
and other such details. Like Boyatzis’s (1998)
account of a thematic code, this model is then
applied to (and revised in relation to) the data.
See Figures 2/4 for visual representations of a
thematic maps and its refinement. Another example of a thematic map / this time in table
form / can be found in Frith and Gleeson (2004).
