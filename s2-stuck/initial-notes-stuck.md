# Initial Notes - Hands Stuck Suggestions Analysis

## Overview
- Analysis of Session 2 (Hands stuck together suggestion) across all participants
- Scoring range: 0-5 for perceived reality of sticking sensation

## Initial Observations by Participant

### P1 (Scored 4/5)
- Conflicting awareness states
- Word/concept of "glue" recurring
- Tactile sensation of "tackiness"
- Stronger sensations than first session
- Minimal visual imagery
- Physical resistance when separating

### P2 (Scored 1/5)
- Lack of belief in possibility
- Attempted to imagine glue
- Clear mental imagery but no physical sensation
- Compared experience to previous session
- Conscious awareness of ability to separate
- Recognition that real glue would be different

### P3 (Scored 1/5)
- Multiple imagery attempts (honey, rope)
- Conscious awareness disrupted imagery
- Some pressure sensation between hands
- Imagery changed/faded over time
- Recognition that real honey wouldn't prevent movement
- Pressing sensation increased with suggestion

### P4 (Scored 4/5)
- Rich tactile sensations (heat, sweat)
- Progressive intensification of experience
- Emotional engagement (joy, coziness)
- Physical anchoring enhancing imagination
- Spontaneous elaboration of suggestions
- Integration of physical and imagined sensations

### P5 (Scored 3/5)
- Concrete architectural imagery (cement beams)
- Differentiated sensation (fingers vs palms)
- Resistance to "sticky" suggestion due to hyperawareness
- Transformation of fingers into structural elements
- Limited emotional engagement
- Analytical approach to experience

### P6 (Scored 5/5)
- Heat and "electrical energy" sensations
- Glue-like tactile experience
- Automatic sticking vs effortful separation
- Basic visual imagery without details
- Physical sensations (heat, stickiness)
- Clear automaticity in response

### P7 (Scored 1/5)
- Multiple levels of awareness
- Analytical processing of instructions
- Light stickiness sensation
- Conscious "playing along"
- Clear reality testing
- Comparison between imagined and actual experience

## Emerging Patterns

### Response Distribution
- High Responders (4-5): P4, P6
- Medium Responders (3): P5
- Low Responders (1): P1, P2, P3, P7

### Common Elements
1. Physical Sensations:
   - Tactile experiences common
   - Heat/energy reported by some
   - Varying levels of resistance

2. Mental Imagery:
   - Different adhesive concepts (glue, honey, cement)
   - Varying levels of imagery detail
   - Architectural/structural metaphors

3. Processing Styles:
   - Analytical vs automatic processing
   - Reality testing variations
   - Different levels of belief engagement

4. Experience Integration:
   - Physical-mental integration varying
   - Emotional engagement differences
   - Automatic vs controlled responses

### Key Observations
1. Success appears linked to:
   - Strong physical sensations
   - Reduced analytical processing
   - Integration of physical-mental experience

2. Barriers to success:
   - Excessive reality testing
   - Hyperawareness of actual sensation
   - Analytical approach

3. Enhancement Strategies:
   - Physical sensation focus
   - Imagery elaboration
   - Emotional engagement

Let me continue with generating initial codes based on these observations.
