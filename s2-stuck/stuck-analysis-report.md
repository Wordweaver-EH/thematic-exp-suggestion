# Thematic Analysis Report: Hands Stuck Suggestions

## Executive Summary
This report presents a comprehensive thematic analysis of the hands stuck suggestion experience across seven participants. The analysis reveals three core themes that characterize successful suggestion implementation: Sensory-Cognitive Integration, Processing Mode Dynamics, and Sensory-Imagery Development. These themes interact in complex ways to determine suggestion effectiveness and participant experience.

## Introduction

### Study Context
- Analysis of Session 2 (Hands stuck together suggestion)
- 7 participants (P1-P7)
- Scoring range: 0-5 for perceived reality
- Focus on experience components and success factors

### Response Distribution
- High Responders (4-5): P4, P6
- Medium Responder (3): P5
- Low Responders (1): P1, P2, P3, P7

## Core Themes

### 1. Sensory-Cognitive Integration
#### Key Findings
- Physical sensations form the foundation

- Progressive development pattern
- Emotional engagement enhances experience

#### Evidence
- P6: "Heat and electrical energy sensations"
- P4: "Rich tactile sensations with progressive intensification"
- P5: "Differentiated sensations between fingers and palms"

### 2. Processing Mode Dynamics
#### Key Findings
- Automatic processing correlates with success
- Analytical processing often inhibitory
- Belief flexibility important
- Maintenance requires balanced awareness

#### Evidence
- P6: Automatic sticking response
- P2: Analytical interference with experience
- P7: Reality testing disrupting experience

### 3. Sensory-Imagery Development
#### Key Findings
- Multiple imagery types employed
- Progressive sensation development
- Integration patterns crucial
- Maintenance strategies important

#### Evidence
- P3: Multiple imagery attempts (honey, rope)
- P5: Concrete architectural imagery
- P4: Progressive sensation development
