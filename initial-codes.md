# Initial Codes from Thematic Analysis

## Code Categories and Descriptions

### Response Characteristics
1. **AUTO** - Automatic/involuntary responses
2. **CTRL** - Controlled/voluntary responses
3. **REAL** - Reality testing behaviors
4. **ANAL** - Analytical processing
5. **IMAG** - Imagery experiences
6. **PHYS** - Physical sensations
7. **EMOT** - Emotional responses
8. **SENS** - Sensory experiences (non-physical)

### Cognitive Processes
9. **META** - Meta-awareness/reflection
10. **EXPC** - Expectations and beliefs
11. **PREV** - Previous experience influence
12. **PERS** - Personal interpretation
13. **CULT** - Cultural/contextual factors
14. **KNOW** - Prior knowledge effects

### Experiential Qualities
15. **INTG** - Integration of experiences
16. **DISS** - Dissociation/separation
17. **TRAN** - Transformation of experience
18. **DEPT** - Depth of experience
19. **RESI** - Resistance to suggestion
20. **ACCP** - Acceptance of suggestion

## Coding Examples

### Participant 1
- Session 1: [AUTO] Unconscious hand movement, [PHYS] Magnetic-like sensation, [META] Reduced thought activity
- Session 2: [INTG] Conflicting awareness, [IMAG] Word/concept of "glue", [PHYS] Tactile sensation
- Session 3: [RESI] No clear auditory perception, [SENS] Increased environmental awareness

### Participant 4
- Session 1: [INTG] Synesthetic perception, [TRAN] Altered visual perception, [DEPT] Rich sensory integration
- Session 2: [PHYS] Rich tactile sensations, [EMOT] Emotional engagement, [TRAN] Progressive intensification
- Session 3: [SENS] Clear auditory hallucination, [EMOT] Strong emotional component, [AUTO] Automatic nature

### Participant 7
- Session 1: [META] Awareness of demand characteristics, [AUTO] Natural movement, [ANAL] Sophisticated understanding
- Session 2: [REAL] Multiple levels of awareness, [CTRL] Conscious "playing along", [ANAL] Analytical processing
- Session 3: [KNOW] Prior knowledge interference, [META] Understanding of mechanisms, [RESI] Clear resistance

## Initial Patterns

### Frequency Patterns
1. Most common codes:
   - [AUTO] Automatic responses
   - [PHYS] Physical sensations
   - [META] Meta-awareness
   - [ANAL] Analytical processing

2. Suggestion-specific patterns:
   - Hand movement: [AUTO], [PHYS] predominant
   - Hands stuck: [IMAG], [REAL] predominant
   - Auditory: [RESI], [SENS] predominant

### Individual Differences
1. Processing styles:
   - Analytical processors (P1, P3, P7)
   - Experiential processors (P4, P6)
   - Mixed processors (P2, P5)

2. Response patterns:
   - Consistent responders (P4, P6)
   - Variable responders (P1, P2, P5)
   - Low responders (P3, P7)
