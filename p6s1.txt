Participant 6 Suggestion 1 (Scored 4/5)

Kevin Sheldrake: So if we had a scale between zero and five, where zero was, you didn't feel any effect at all, and five was your hands moved like the most powerful it could possibly be, where would you score that out of zero to five.
P6: I'd say 4.
Kevin Sheldrake: So you really felt the effect then?
P6: Yeah.
P6: They almost moved.
Kevin Sheldrake: When I read you that suggestion what sort of thoughts were going through your mind in terms of what you thought might happen, or what you were thinking about your hands or the experiment? Was there anything like that?
P6: Erm::... no, I was just thinking about someone like... try to like... put them together like, pull them together somehow... that way, for some reason. That's the way my brain works.
Kevin Sheldrake: Would you say that was more imagination? Was that an imagined thing do you think?
P6: Erm::... yeah, I wasn't thinking about it. It would it literally happened automatically.
Kevin Sheldrake: So so you weren't making that imagination or those thoughts?
P6: No.
Kevin Sheldrake: They just came to you?
P6: Yeah.
Kevin Sheldrake: and how did it feel when it was going on?
P6: Erm:: It felt a bit strong.
Kevin Sheldrake: Was that interesting or exciting in any way?
P6: Yeah, it is because even last experiment I had quite like like, quite high score. And like, was it called the the ten, point, scale, five point scale, yeah.
Kevin Sheldrake: the phenomenological control scale?
P6: Yeah.
Kevin Sheldrake: Would you say that was surprising to notice that sort of thing happening like these thoughts in your mind? Or is that just normal? Would that be normal?
P6: Not not really, because I guess your telling to my brain... like you kind of need to act that way. But I'm not acting in the same time. So there is gonna be. That's a sort of effect.
P6: It's going to happen... Yeah, it's like... even if I'm not moving. But it just it feels like it.
