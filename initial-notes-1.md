# Initial Notes - First Reading

## Overview
- Dataset consists of transcripts from 7 participants (P1-P7)
- Each participant has 3 sessions (S1-S3)
- Total of 21 transcript files
- Appears to be a study involving different suggestions/exercises

## Initial Observations from P1's Sessions

### Session 1 (Scored 4/5)
- Exercise involved hand movement/magnetism suggestion
- Initial anxiety about being observed/expectations
- Participant experienced:
  - Unconscious hand movement
  - Magnetic-like sensation between hands
  - Reduced thought activity/quieter mind
  - Increased bodily awareness (hands)
  - No strong mental imagery
  - Warmth and heaviness in hands

### Session 2 (Scored 4/5)
- Exercise involved suggestion about hands being stuck
- Different but similar to first session
- Key experiences:
  - Tactile sensation of "tackiness"
  - Resistance when trying to separate hands
  - Conflicting awareness (knowing hands weren't stuck vs feeling they were)
  - Word/concept of "glue" recurring
  - Stronger sensations than first session
  - Again, minimal visual imagery

### Session 3 (Scored 1/5)
- Audio suggestion exercise ("Happy Birthday" song)
- Much less successful than previous sessions
- Notable points:
  - No clear auditory perception
  - Increased awareness of actual environmental sounds
  - Heightened physical awareness of ears
  - Internal conflict between imagination and reality
  - More analytical/questioning mindset

### Common Themes in P1's Sessions
1. Varying levels of response to different types of suggestions
2. Consistent pattern of increased bodily awareness
3. Limited visual/mental imagery across sessions
4. Tendency to analyze and question experiences
5. Ability to maintain dual awareness (reality vs suggestion)
