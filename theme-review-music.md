# Theme Review and Refinement - Auditory Suggestions

## Theme Evaluation Process

### 1. Processing Mode Dichotomy
#### Strength Assessment
- **Coherence**: Strong internal consistency
- **Distinctiveness**: Clear differentiation from other themes
- **Data Support**: Well-supported across participants
- **Explanatory Power**: High predictive value for success

#### Refinement Needs
- Consider splitting into:
  1. Analytical Interference
  2. Automatic Facilitation

#### Decision
- Maintain as primary theme with two sub-components
- Emphasize interaction between processes

### 2. Modality Integration and Compensation
#### Strength Assessment
- **Coherence**: Moderate internal consistency
- **Distinctiveness**: Some overlap with other themes
- **Data Support**: Variable across participants
- **Explanatory Power**: Moderate predictive value

#### Refinement Needs
- Focus more on integration than compensation
- Consider merging visual aspects with reality testing
- Strengthen emotional integration component

#### Decision
- Reframe as "Multimodal Experience Integration"
- Incorporate emotional aspects more centrally

### 3. Internal-External Navigation
#### Strength Assessment
- **Coherence**: Strong internal consistency
- **Distinctiveness**: Unique to auditory experience
- **Data Support**: Universal across participants
- **Explanatory Power**: High explanatory value

#### Refinement Needs
- Clarify relationship with processing modes
- Develop volume modulation aspect
- Include perceptual boundary concepts

#### Decision
- Maintain as primary theme
- Expand theoretical framework

### 4. Cultural and Personal Integration
#### Strength Assessment
- **Coherence**: Moderate internal consistency
- **Distinctiveness**: Some unique elements
- **Data Support**: Limited but significant examples
- **Explanatory Power**: Important for success cases

#### Refinement Needs
- Strengthen connection to experience mechanism
- Clarify role in success facilitation
- Integrate with emotional aspects

#### Decision
- Merge with emotional components
- Maintain as "Personal Meaning Integration"

### 5. Reality Testing and Belief
#### Strength Assessment
- **Coherence**: Strong internal consistency
- **Distinctiveness**: Some overlap with processing
- **Data Support**: Well-documented across cases
- **Explanatory Power**: Critical for understanding barriers

#### Refinement Needs
- Clarify relationship with analytical processing
- Develop belief flexibility concept
- Include expectation management

#### Decision
- Integrate partially with processing mode
- Maintain distinct belief components
